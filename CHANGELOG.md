## 2026-07-12 — Rescue & workspace setup

- **Rescued the 2019 originals verbatim** into git history (commit
  `rescue: original 2019 lemon piano files`) before touching anything.
- **Translated everything to English**: folder/file names, code comments, and
  identifiers (active firmware and archived references).
- **Restructured to a PlatformIO workspace**: `Piano_Limones_v4/` →
  `firmware/` (`src/main.cpp` + `include/notes.h` + `platformio.ini` with
  `nanoatmega328` / `nanoatmega328new` / `uno` envs); `Banana-Piano-Original/`
  → `archive/banana-piano-original/` (banana-piano, keyboard-test,
  game-prototype); schematics → `docs/`.
- **Reconstructed one corrupted line**: `Duracion` (now `NOTE_DURATION`) had
  stray keystrokes (`= 5çkp\`ñ´sca…0;`) and didn't compile — restored to
  `50` ms. No other behavior changes; 2019 bugs are preserved and catalogued
  in `TODO.md`.
- **Wrote the docs**: README (game rules, secret codes, lineage, quick start),
  `docs/HARDWARE.md` (deduced pin map + wiring + sensing physics), `TODO.md`
  (14-item fix roadmap), `CLAUDE.md`, `.gitignore`.
